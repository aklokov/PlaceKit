PlaceKit
========

Placeholders, lorem ipsum, and fake data oh my!

For all of your early-development work. Nothing motivates a designer more than seeing random meat-based images on an app they are working with.

Provides substance to your in-progress application for missing:

- Image content
- Text content
- Fake data
    - Names
    - Phone numbers
    - Random numbers

In addition provides some quick methods for getting random geometrical structs:

- Random CGSize
- Random CGRect
- Random CGPoint enclosed in CGRect
- Etc.
